Welcome to our team’s blog. In this blog post we will introduce our Team, Project and our motivations to take up the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers”.


## Our Project
The project we have selected to work on is 'Activity Monitoring'. Time management is a key aspect for every student. Developing an app which could help every student to monitor their progress in studies, project/thesis work, exercise and leisure will help them to use their time efficiently.


## Our Team - Curry Wurst

I believe that the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers" is a great opportunity not only to learn coding and develop an android app but also to learn the Project management skills required for any software engineer.</td>

I am eager to learn a profound approach to develop software in a team and I have always wanted to create my own mobile applications.</td>

## Complementary Skills


For any team to be successful it needs to have members with complementary skills. Our team is filled with people possessing diverse skillsets which will help us to work together and reach our end goal successfully. Some of the team members are well versed in Agile process and programming, while others are creative and good at documentation and organizing.


## Roles and Responsibilities


**Scrum Master:** As the Scrum Master, Moritz is accountable to remove challenges faced by the team in providing the product goals and deliverables.


**Quality Control:** Quang and Dean are in charge of maintaining the quality of all the deliverables and the product.


**Coordinator:** Jahnavi is the main coordinator between the Product owner and the team.


Apart from these roles everyone is responsible for working with each other on the design and testing of the product


## Communication


We are using GitHub to share, merge and update our work and ZenHub for project management. We will use Slack and Facebook messenger for communication. We will have weekly team meetings to discuss the progress of the project.

## Flexibility
Team work always brings uncertainty. May it be with respect to skills or in collaborating with the team members. As a team, we have planned to share each task between two team members. This will enable us to work seamlessly even if one of the team members is unable to deliver.
