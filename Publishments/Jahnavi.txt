Jahnavi from India, an aspiring Computer Engineer. 
25 years old. 
I am currently in my second semester DE and hold a bachelors degree in electronics and communication engineering. 
3 years of work experience in IT industry. 
Skills : Organisational and managerial skills.   
I always wanted to learn coding, but somehow refrained from doing so, in the past.I belive that the course "Introduction to software engineering for engineers" is a great oppurtunity not only to learn coding and develop an android app but also to learn the Project management skills required for any software engineering team.
