Details and motivation

Industrial Engineering Bachelor Degree
2nd Semester DE

I think, the principles of software engineering and requirement engineering are crucial skills for everybody who wants to work in a software engineering field. I am eager to learn a profound approach to develop software in a team. In my opionion, I will also benefit more from a lecture which requires ongoing commitment, than I would from one where there is only an exam in the end of the semester. Furthermore, I would like to learn how to program my own apps, so it's even better that i can combine this with my curriculum by attending this course.
